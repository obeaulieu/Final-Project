# Final-Project
This program organizes the laser scans and phoographs collected during the fluvial terrace experiments into two NetCDF data sets.
They will be labeled ExperimentScans.nc and ExperimentPhotographs.nc. 
The output will be a .nc file with all variables and dimensions included for the scans and photos.
The laser scans being organized must already be relabeled to include the time. (ex TopoDat_0000279.DAT)
And the images must be organized so the time is included in the name. (ex. Img1.jpg)
